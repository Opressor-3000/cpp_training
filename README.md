# C++ Training Project

This project is designed for learning the C++ language and its idioms by solving various tasks. Throughout the project, I explore the basics of the language syntax, the standard library, and advance to more complex language concepts.

## Description

The project consists of a series of tasks, each focused on a specific topic or concept in C++. Tasks may include:

* Basic syntax
* Pointers and references
* Data structures (arrays, lists, stack, queue, etc.)
* Object-Oriented Programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism
* Algorithms and Standard Library (STL)
* Smart pointers and memory management
* Exceptions and error handling
* Multithreading and concurrency
* Templates and metaprogramming

Each task is accompanied by a brief explanation of the theory and example code.

## Project Goals

* Learn the fundamentals of C++.
* Master common C++ idioms.
* Develop skills with the compiler and the standard library.
* Apply learned knowledge by solving practical tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several folders, each containing solutions for specific topics:
